<h2 id="_authentication">Authentication</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="exampleblock lead">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Authentication is the process of verifying identity.
In the context of users, it is the process of establishing the identity of a person.
There are different ways to accomplish this (some better than others).
Attackers have developed many techniques to attack authentication, and we need to adapt and adopt new approaches to protect our accounts.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_usernames_and_passwords">Usernames and Passwords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The oldest (and most well-known) approach to digital authentication is the use of usernames and passwords.
Users need to provide their username (usually not considered a secret) and their password (which <strong>should</strong> be considered a secret) to authenticate to a system or service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with this approach is that humans have difficulty thinking up passwords that are hard for a computer to guess and have a hard time remembering multiple, more secure passwords.
Because of these human weaknesses, passwords are usually easy to guess and reused.
Attackers can take advantage of both of these human weaknesses.
== Brute Force Attacks
Computers enable the automation of menial tasks, and attackers have developed tools and techniques to use computers to attack passwords.
Over time, attackers have built lists of common-used passwords.
They can use computers to try different usernames and password combinations automatically.
Whether they do it against live systems or against hashed (a form of one-way encryption) values taken from a system/service, they are usually successful in cracking at least a small number of accounts with minimal manual effort.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_credential_stuffing_attacks">Credential Stuffing Attacks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because people have difficulty remembering multiple passwords, they usually cope with this by reusing their credentials.
Once an attacker has cracked a user&#8217;s account on one system/service, they have a high probability of success by trying the same credentials against other services.
The practice of reusing credentials means that an attacker can compromise multiple accounts through a single account&#8217;s compromise.</p>

<p>To overcome these weaknesses in human-generated and remembered credentials, we recommend the following approaches when using usernames and passwords:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a password manager to remember your passwords (making it easier to use different passwords for each account).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a password manager to generate your passwords.
Generating passwords is another thing computers do better than humans.</p>

<h3 id="_a_better_way">A Better Way</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve only discussed authentication using 'something we know,' but there are better ways to authenticate.
Using more than one factor or multi-factor authentication (MFA) to authenticate makes an attack that much more difficult for your attacker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A factor can be any of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Something you know (like a password or passphrase)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something you have (like a key)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something you are (biometrics - usually fingerprints)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some*where* you are (When&#8217;s the last time you connected to your account from Russia?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: There may be other factors besides these.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_something_you_have">Something You Have</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people use keys in their everyday life.
So using keys is something people generally understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Physical tokens such as FIDO2 keys (which you usually plug into a USB port) are a good example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, You can install Authentication apps on most phones that can generate one-time codes.
To obtain the code, you must have the device with the app installed and configured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples of login tokens:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_rsa_securid">RSA SecurID</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RSA SecurID product is a key-fob that provides a one-time passcode (OTP) which, when combined
with a PIN, becomes the login secret.
This solution requires that the server and the key-fob keep close sync with their time.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="images/rsa.jpg" alt="rsa">
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_universal_two_factor">Universal Two Factor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another key-fob-based authentication mechanism is to use a Universal Two-Factor (U2F) token.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One such token is a Yubikey.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/yubi.jpg" alt="yubi">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_something_you_are">Something You Are</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Biometrics are usually unique to an individual, therefore, usually an effective form of authentication.
Biometrics data is replicable and challenging, if not impossible, to change, so it is best to combine it with other authentication factors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_somewhere_you_are">Somewhere You Are</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another less common method of authentication is location.
People tend to establish a physical footprint of places they go.
If there is an attempt to log in from a location far removed from your fingerprint, systems may block or require additional verification before granting access.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multi_factor_for_the_win">Multi-factor for the Win</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Combining multiple factors of authentication before gaining access is the most secure way to safeguard accounts.
Whenever possible, use multi-factor authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As passwords become less complicated to attack, the need to switch to multi-factor authentication will become more urgent.</p>

<h2 id="_data_classification_and_handling_protecting_and_using_data">Data Classification and Handling: Protecting and Using Data</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="exampleblock lead">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data has sometimes called 'the new oil' (the fuel for our modern economy/society), but it can also be dangerous if not adequately protected.
Not all data is created equal.
Some data types merit the greatest protections, and other types of data should be more generally available.
Data classification and handling are all about categorizing the data appropriately and applying the proper controls.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_value_and_danger_of_data">The Value and Danger of Data</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having the right information available improves decision-making and allows for better allocation of resources.
An organization that can obtain, enrich, and utilize data will have significant advantages over its competitors that can&#8217;t.
Data can be a strategic competitive advantage.
It is impossible to conceive an organization of significant size that doesn&#8217;t leverage data in its operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wherever there is the potential to do great good, there is also the potential to do great evil.
The potential for significant damage exists if data is not adequately protected.
Public embarrassment, fraud, theft, and other crimes come from the misuse of data.
Usually, we are only concerned with protecting data confidentiality, but losing access to data could also have serious adverse effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the challenge is ensuring the appropriate use of data while safeguarding from abuse.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_not_all_data_is_created_equal">Not All Data is Created Equal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some data types, for example, payment card data, demand and deserve the application of significant protections to prevent fraud.
Other data types should have some protections applied, but making this data more accessible is needed for business reasons (for example, business intelligence and financial reports).
Still, other types of data should be generally available (they pose no serious risks and are beneficial to large groups (for example, weather forecasts).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Protecting data can be expensive.
Encrypting and decrypting data promptly requires significant resources.
With some data, it is an appropriate safeguard.
With other data is a waste of resources.
Understanding your data and applying the right amount of protection is an essential process for most organizations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deciding_how_much_protection_is_appropriate">Deciding How Much Protection is Appropriate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two drivers for the protection of data, internal and external.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internal drivers for protecting data include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk management and opportunity costs associated with applying the protections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If data loss would compromise an organization&#8217;s competitive advantage, then more restrictive protections would be appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, protecting data too much could interfere with the organization realizing its mission.
If this was the case, then some controls may work, while others would not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>External drivers for protecting data include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Laws/regulations and contracts/relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory requirements or contract obligations from a partner may dictate the types of safeguards one must use when protecting data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While you might negotiate with some partners, usually, most governments are not as malleable.
It is essential to understand that compliance is the floor (not the ceiling).
These requirements are the minimum.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_many_classification_levels_should_an_organization_have">How Many Classification Levels Should an Organization Have?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The U.S. Military (who has a long history of needing to protect data) has three classification levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidential - damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secret - grave damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top Secret - exceptionally grave damage</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also an 'unclassified' category for data (used for data that doesn&#8217;t require special protection).
The amount of damage that unauthorized disclosure of data would cause defines the classification level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend finding the right balance between appropriately protecting the data and overprotecting data.
Too many data classification levels will confuse people.
Too few will result in resources wasted and operations unnecessarily complicated.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making data classification decisions every time someone collects or creates data is inefficient.
Therefore, the recommendation is that data be classified when you decide to produce/consume it (upfront).
This upfront classification enables all follow-on work and management associated with the data to be well understood and handled appropriately.</p>

<p>Check the SSL/TLS certificates of any site you "log in" to.
Phishing sites often look <strong>JUST</strong> like the proper site.
Yes, even phishing sites are using certificates to have you blindly trust that the SSL/TLS certificate is correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use a browser-integrated password manager.
Browser-integrated password managers will ensure that the username and password are getting pasted into the correct site.
Password managers reduce the chance that you&#8217;ll fall for a well-made phishing site.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all sites that support it.
Multi-factor authentication will secure your online account by requiring you to submit a second authentication factor other than your password.
MFA will make your account more secure.

Humans are the ultimate targets and the most effective line of defense.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deception">Deception</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because authentication tools are not widely utilized and the platform enjoys an unearned amount of trust, deception is frequently too easy to accomplish.
Victims doubt only when given reason, meaning as long as the attacker doesn&#8217;t raise red flags too blatantly.
Without these red flags, we are willing to believe most assertions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the famous Nigerian Prince scams took in far too many people.
Someone you don&#8217;t know (and never met) tells you that they need your help and asks you to open bank accounts and deposit checks from financial institutions you haven&#8217;t investigated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We must replace trust with doubt.
If there is anything out of the usual pattern or any inconsistencies, you should challenge and verify them.
Leaders should not just tolerate their people double-checking but demand it and demonstrate appreciation for doing so.</p>

Between information available on the organization&#8217;s website(s), social media, and publicly available government records, attackers have an abundance of available information.
The chance is that they can recreate your organization&#8217;s organizational chart with reasonable accuracy.
If they want to impersonate an external (but real) agency or organization, they have enough information available to create a persona that will mostly 'check out.'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be wary of unusual requests from people in leadership positions within your organization.
Reach out to them via different, trusted channels of communication to verify.
Using out-of-band communication methods should be the standard practice.

<h3 id="_the_most_common_attack">The Most Common Attack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, the most commonly encountered email attack is phishing.
Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent email messages where the attacker impersonates an authority or trusted person/party to get a victim to reveal confidential or personal information.
Phishing is responsible for a large percentage of security incidents (specifically data breaches) today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The real target of a phishing attack is a human, email (or other communications channels) are only the delivery method.
Everyone is vulnerable to being manipulated.
Almost all approaches try to get you to respond/act before you have an opportunity to think through and apply procedure or critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply slowing down and following established procedures will do a lot to reduce the probability of falling victim to a phishing attack.
Contacting the supposed sender via a different, trusted communications channel (internal chat, phone, etc.) before taking action is another powerful way to avoid falling victim.</p>

<p>The Cybersecurity industry has observed a new threat emerging in the last few years, business email compromise.
Business email compromise is when an attacker gains access to your work email account.</p>

<h2 id="_email_mistakes">Email Mistakes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Email is one of the oldest and most commonly used communications services on the Internet.
Nearly everyone uses email nearly every day.
Like other parts of our lives, there are many ways to make mistakes while using email.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_weak_and_reused_passwords">Weak and Reused Passwords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the reuse or use of weak passwords is always discouraged, these mistakes can prove particularly dangerous/problematic when it comes to email.
The reason is that most online services allow you to reset your credentials (if you forgot or suspect that they are compromised) using email.
A compromised email account places almost all of your online accounts at risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recommendations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a password manager to generate and store unique credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not reuse passwords (especially when it comes to email accounts)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use passphrases for added security (length is the most crucial element of a secret&#8217;s security)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="_intermingling_work_and_personal_activities">Intermingling Work and Personal activities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using work email for personal use can compromise your privacy.
Business accounts are frequently monitored (or at least subject to inspection), which means your personal affairs are no longer private.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on your business and jurisdiction, using personal accounts for organizational purposes could be illegal.
Usually, in litigation, relevant email is discoverable, which means that you could have lawyers crawling through your personal email.
To safeguard your privacy, avoid using personal accounts and equipment for business purposes.</p>

<h3 id="_sending_sensitive_information">Sending Sensitive Information</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without applying additional protections, email is more like a postcard than a sealed envelope.
Anyone (and anything) that your email passes through (or is stored on) has an opportunity to read the contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will talk about some measures you can take to safeguard email in other modules, but understand that many of these measures are not commonly utilized or require both parties to support them.
You should not send information such as government identification numbers, payment card data, personal financial or credit data via email.
There may also be other types of data that are too sensitive to send over email.
When in doubt, assume that email is insufficiently secure to send sensitive data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_unintended_recipients">Unintended Recipients</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though email is not secure enough to send sensitive data, you will frequently conduct such sensitive communications via email.
Due to human error and autocompletion of email addresses, it is too easy to send an email to someone you didn&#8217;t intend to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should double-check the recipients before sending an email message (primarily if the content is for specific audiences).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_clicking_on_links">Clicking on Links</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking on links is a pattern of behavior we bring with us from browsing the web.
The problem is that what you see in the email application may vary from where the link takes you.
An intelligent attacker could cause some significant harm from you clicking on a link they&#8217;ve crafted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend going to the website/service independently of the link.
Even if it looks like it is coming from a legitimate account, it could be someone spoofing the origin email address or the sender has a compromised account.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operational Security (OPSEC) is the process of protecting data in aggregate to prevent use by attackers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To practice good OPSEC, one must look at the entirety of the data to determine if sharing
said data might compromise security.
Look at the background of the photos you take.
Are you sharing more information than you planned?</p>

<p>High-value targets often need to distribute information to large groups.
A suitable method for this distribution is to generate the information in an internal wiki
and post the link to the wiki page into the email for broadcast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This method does two things, makes the canonical location for the information the wiki,
which can be updated at will and helps to verify that the information is valid as an
an attacker would have to compromise both the wiki and email logins to post it there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There should also be a global policy in place for <strong>EVERY</strong> coworker to report suspicious activity <strong>EVERY TIME</strong>.
Constant reporting is vital to help IT and security teams to see trends around
these suspicious events.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point in the past, we found it necessary to prove our identity to computer systems.
It was probably because it was expedient; an identifier (usually a username) and a secret was the solution.
Generally, it seemed to work, and so whenever the need for authentication arose, we defaulted to this solution.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Humans struggle with two things that make using passwords problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, humans struggle to think of strong passwords.
Strong passwords are hard to guess.
Humans are (sometimes) lazy and creatures to habit.
We frequently do only what is required (this makes guessing a password much easier).
Additionally, we are creatures of habit, and these habits mean that the passwords we create are usually predictable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, humans struggle to remember things.
Because of this, we prefer simplicity and reusing those things we do have to remember.
Both of these preferences result in generally bad practices with passwords.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an adversary can acquire a copy of the database that stores the hashes used to verify if a password is correct.
In this context, a hash is the result of a one-way processing of a password.
While it shouldn&#8217;t be possible to process the hash and retrieve the original password, it may be possible to use previously cracked hashes (Rainbow Tables).
When they work, they are a quick way to get passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using previously used passwords will make your passwords vulnerable to this kind of attack.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_credential_stuffing">Credential Stuffing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An increasingly common attack against password reuse is 'Credential Stuffing.'  Once an adversary has obtained some usernames and passwords, they will attempt to use them against other systems/services.
Credential stuffing is frequently effective and enables an adversary to take over (at least a large) part of the victim&#8217;s online life.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we are familiar with how human weaknesses in creating and using passwords make us vulnerable, we are ready to discuss a solution (Password Managers).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Password Managers' functionality varies, they all help generate strong passwords and facilitate using unique passwords for each system/service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_generating_strong_passwords">Generating Strong Passwords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Strong Passwords (or even better, passphrases) have specific characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Length (to defend against brute force attacks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity (again, to defend against brute force attacks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique (so that the compromise of a password doesn&#8217;t expose other services to attack)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard to guess (sometimes called entropy)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, significant care, understanding, and thought have been put into enabling password managers to generate strong passwords.
A password generated by a password manager will fare better than a password a human can generate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_using_unique_passwords">Using Unique Passwords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to generating strong passwords, password managers will enable you to store a different password for each of your accounts.
You will need to remember the password that gets you on your local computer and access the password manager, but after that, you won&#8217;t need to remember any of the passwords for your online accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Password managers make it a lot easier to use unique passwords for your accounts (significantly improving your digital security).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_selecting_a_password_manager">Selecting a Password Manager.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you work for an organization, they have likely selected a password manager for you to use.
If this is the case, you should familiarize yourself with it (so that you use it securely and obtain the most significant benefit from it).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to use a password manager for your own needs, you should investigate the available options.
Yes, you want security, but you also want it to be as useful (and usable) as possible (a solution you don&#8217;t use is not a solution).
After reading about the various options, We recommend that you try a few of them out.</p>

<p>Once you decide to use a password manager, it will become one of your online life&#8217;s essential parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever solution you select, it is vital that you safeguard your password manager.
In some cases, it will mean selecting a particularly strong password to prevent unauthorized access to your password manager.
In other cases, it will also include making sure you have a safe backup of your password manager data file.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_one_last_thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Password Managers can significantly improve your security online, but it is still highly recommended that you use multi-factor authentication whenever (and wherever) possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multi-factor authentication involves using something besides just a password to gain access to an account.
Some examples are physical tokens, biometrics, and location.</p>

<p>Mobile devices (phones, tablets, and other devices) are the ubiquitous objects of modern life.
They present an incredible concentration functionality, but they also present significant security concerns.
Understanding the risks and what you can do to mitigate them will help you make informed decisions about how and when you use mobile devices.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tracking_devices_that_make_phone_calls">Tracking Devices That Make Phone Calls</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About a decade ago, a security expert referred to mobile phones as 'tracking devices that make phone calls.'  The way mobile phone networks have been architected and a principal focus on functionality, mobile phones (and most mobile devices) have de-emphasized privacy and security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These devices, even if not infected/compromised, leak important data about you.
For example, even if you are not making a phone call, the people who manage the phone network can track your real-time location.
Until recently, any application installed on your device could access the 'clipboard' (where you cut, copy, and paste data temporarily) at any time.
Voice commands are usually processed in the cloud (at the vendor&#8217;s data centers), which means they likely have access to anything you say in the device&#8217;s proximity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Efforts to make them 'just work' mean that when designers chose between privacy/security and usability, the choice was almost always prejudiced towards usability.
Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)">global surveillance disclosures in 2013</a>, some of the vendors have started to enable privacy/security features without compromising the value proposition that mobile devices present to users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will talk about the risks and the things you can do to improve your mobile device usage. Still, if you ever absolutely need a private conversation, it is recommended that you keep the phone/tablet in a different room.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_being_popular_paints_a_target_on_your_back">Being Popular Paints a Target on Your Back</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any system, service, or device that becomes sufficiently popular (and mobile devices certainly qualify), will attract adversaries (both criminal and nation-state) to compromise and exploit them.
Even with the vendors' best efforts, there is still a high probability that a determined adversary will find a way to gain access or subvert it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not to say you should give up hope (or throw away your mobile devices), but that you should realize the potential of the hostile environment in which you operate.
Be mindful of the clues we will talk about, and take the measures we recommend, and you can significantly improve the security of your mobile devices.</p>

<h3 id="_make_sure_your_devices_are_encrypted">Make Sure Your Devices are Encrypted</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is always a chance that your mobile devices might leave your physical control (for example: lost or forgotten).
When that happens, you will want to ensure that the device&#8217;s data is protected from those who have it in their possession.
Today, most vendors will enable encryption on mobile devices by default.
Still, it is a good idea/practice to verify that this is the case.
Usually, you can go into the device&#8217;s settings and check/enable this.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change/reset the credentials associated with any account that was accessible on the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the device in 'Airplane mode' (disable network connectivity - Wifi/Cell network access).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either get the device securely wiped or inspected by a provider capable of assessing the device&#8217;s security.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you use a mobile device (either personally or organizationally owned) for business. In that case, there is a strong probability that the organization you work for will require that you enroll it in their mobile device management system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mobile device management enables the organization to lock, wipe, inspect, update, or selectively delete a mobile device.
Tools like this are a requirement because the organization has an interest (or obligation) to safeguard the data/services that the device can access.
Understand that you will lose a measure of control over the device if it is enrolled in mobile device management.
If you want/need to keep your personal activities private from that organization, then it is recommended that you don&#8217;t conduct those activities on a managed device.</p>

<p>'Jailbreaking' or 'rooting' a mobile device is disabling some/all of the mobile device security controls.
Jailbreaking is frequently done to install software or configure the device that the default controls would otherwise prevent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is essential to realize that you take a significant risk when you do this.
The built-in controls on mobile devices are (at least in part) meant to prevent you from installing potentially malicious software or expose you to other uncontrolled risks.
If you want to do this, recognize that this is not a supported or encouraged action, and you accept additional responsibility for what happens with your device.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you are curious and want to play with programs/functionality that isn&#8217;t generally available through official sources. In that case, we recommend that you don&#8217;t do so with the device you use daily.
In this case, purchase or use another device.</p>

<h3 id="_physical_security_2">Physical Security</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a hostile actor gains physical access to your device, then you should probably consider it compromised.
They can implant software/hardware on the device to grant them control or access to the device in the future.

<p>Many people use short Messaging Service (SMS) to send text messages.
It is important to know that these messages can be read, intercepted, or diverted to/by others.
Like email, this service was initially conceived and designed without concern for how attackers could abuse it, and therefore should not be trusted for sensitive communications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One application that SMS has been used for is an additional factor for authentication.
Adversaries have learned how to exploit SMS, and using it for multi-factor authentication is not recommended.
Instead, you should use applications built explicitly for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>Bluetooth enables you to attach or utilize nearby devices wirelessly to extend the functionality of your device.
The problem with Bluetooth is that it can also expose your device to attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One example of an attack is 'Bluesnarfing.'  This attack enables others to gain unauthorized access to information on your device (for example, calendars, contact lists, emails, text messages).
In addition to 'Bluesnarfing', there are other possible attacks that exploit Bluetooth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Disable Bluetooth on your mobile devices if you don&#8217;t use it.
Enable it only for the time you need/use it.
Frequently check your mobile devices to see which Bluetooth devices have paired with them.
Remove any/all unexpected devices.</p>

<p>So the two most important questions we need to answer are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can we do to prevent it from happening, or at least minimize the impact?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_losing_your_device">Losing Your Device</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first risk we&#8217;ll discuss is the most obvious scenario; a lost (or stolen) device (almost all of us have lost a mobile device).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the cost associated with replacing (and setting up) a replacement device is significant, it may be negligible compared with the damage associated with losing control of sensitive information (both work and personal).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What can you do to minimize the risks?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check for your devices frequently.
At least before departing an area and upon arrival at a new area.
It is better to recognize a device has been lost promptly when you are best positioned to remedy the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypt your devices.
If you lose a device, then encrypting it gives you the greatest assurance that those who come into possession of it won&#8217;t gain access to your sensitive information.
Devices to be encrypted include external storage devices (thumb drives and hard drives).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the device requires unlocking before accessing it;  a trade-off between security and convenience.
Use the most secure means to control access to your device that is practicable to you.
If you know the information is particularly sensitive, then a more secure means of authentication is recommended.
If possible, use multi-factor authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use your device to support multi-factor authentication, make sure you have alternative means of authenticating if your device is lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install or utilize device management tools to enable you to wipe the lost device remotely.
Not always an option, but it can help you sleep at night if it is.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_uncontrolled_insecure_operating_environments">Uncontrolled/Insecure Operating Environments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You probably don&#8217;t think too much about the controls in place in your home or office (for example, not just anyone has access to your home).
While you are away from these environments, you are much more exposed.
While not recommended, leaving your laptop unlocked and walking away from it in your home or office poses significantly less risk than doing the same thing at a corner coffee shop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What can you do to minimize the risks?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your device processes or stores sensitive information, you should avoid working in insecure/uncontrolled places.
If you need to do something in an insecure environment, you should seek out an isolated area, with your back to a wall, and where you can see other people approaching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We recommend securing your network traffic with a VPN connection.
You probably have limited information about the controls of hazards present in an uncontrolled environment; therefore, you should assume that hostile actors are present and sniffing the network traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid accessing any particularly sensitive information or services while you are in an uncontrolled environment.
Wait until you are back inside a more controlled environment (if at all possible).</p>
</li>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_traveling_internationally">Traveling Internationally</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking and using your mobile devices when you travel internationally exposes you to particular hazards.
In many countries, privacy protections (if they exist) are most often weakest at airports.
To gain transit through or gain entry to a country, you probably need to submit to searches of your person and devices.
While most of these searches are perfunctory, other searches can be rather intrusive.
Additionally, some countries have significantly higher criminal activity than your originating country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What can you do to minimize the risks?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research the countries you are traveling to (and through) to understand their privacy protections, security/inspection measures, and criminal activity concerns.
The last thing you want to do is get surprised along the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider minimizing the devices (or the sensitive data) you bring with you.
If you don&#8217;t need it for what you intend to do, it is probably best to avoid bringing it with you.
If you need to use a phone to communicate, but you don&#8217;t want to risk much of your personal information, then using an alternate phone or wiping your phone may be something you&#8217;ll want to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use thin clients (if your organization allows/supports them).
A thin client doesn&#8217;t allow/enable storing information on them; therefore, the risk associated with losing or allowing someone to inspect the device is less than with conventional devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, using a VPN connection to secure your network traffic.
It is safe to assume that all traffic is being sniffed by countries and criminal operations while traveling abroad.
Encrypting all your communications is an essential security measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever possible, do not leave your devices unattended.
If an adversary has physical access to your devices, they could tamper with them to compromise their security.
Some attacks are at the hardware-level and are invisible to your system&#8217;s security measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek assistance from your organization&#8217;s security personnel before traveling.
They might be able to identify any particular threats and help you mitigate them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update your devices before traveling.
Two reasons for this.
First, it makes sure that your devices are protected against any vulnerabilities that its vendors have fixed before your departure.
Second, it will minimize your need to update while you are using potentially hostile networks.
Some known attacks leverage software updates to compromise devices.
While this can be attempted anywhere, updating while traveling makes you particularly vulnerable.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="_summary">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While mobile devices have become ubiquitous, they also open us up to significant risks.
Taking the time to prepare and adjust your computing practices can mitigate (if not eliminate) most of these risks.
Encrypting your mobile devices, exercising situational awareness, using a VPN to protect your network traffic, keeping your devices up-to-date are some of the things you can do to protect yourself and your sensitive data.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Robert Cialdini wrote a book on the 'key principles of "Influence"<a href="#influence: R. Cialdini">[influence: R. Cialdini]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These principles include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_key_principle_reciprocity">Key Principle&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Reciprocity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reciprocity&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;aka "Returning the Favor".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reciprocity is used in a social engineering attack by offering a small gift or concession to a target and asking the target to do something to reciprocate (such as change a password or open a locked door).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to use reciprocity is to ask a considerable favor which the target declines to do. At this point, the attacker asks a smaller favor (their real goal) and the target can feel compelled to reciprocate on the concession of backing off the original favor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_key_principle_commitment">Key Principle&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Commitment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Commitment&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;aka "I want to sign up later".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When people commit to a future action or goal, they are more likely to follow through with that action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creators of web popups use this tactic "I&#8217;ll sign up later" instead of "Cancel" or "No Thanks".</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>People will conform to what they see other people doing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Social engineering comes through a few different vectors:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Vishing</dt>
<dd>
<p>aka "Voice Phishing"
Vishing is using Social engineering over the telephone system.
This method is used as an attack by purporting to be a bank or other organization that the target does business with to directly steal information such as usernames, passwords, and account info.
This method is also used to reconnoiter for other information in a multi-stage attack.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Phishing</dt>
<dd>
<p>Using electronic communications such as email or websites to gather private or secure information.
Phishing email scams send links to authentic-looking fraudulent sites, which then gather your personal information (usernames, passwords, accounts, Card PINs).
Often phishing attacks use a request to "verify" information and use "loss aversion" principles to ensure compliance.
An example of this method would be the request to provide or verify a credit card number to continue using an online service.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Smishing</dt>
<dd>
<p>Using SMS text messages in a social engineering attack.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Impersonation</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pretending to be another person to gain access;
including using another person&#8217;s credentials to gain access to a location or system.</p>

<h2 id="_updates_2">Updates</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="exampleblock lead">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over time, mistakes and vulnerabilities are found in every system.
To stay secure, most mature vendors will provide a way to update their products.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_updates_are_mostly_for_security">Updates are Mostly for Security</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With few exceptions, most updates are to fix vulnerabilities in products and software.
Even with the most rigorous controls and processes, software developers will make mistakes.
It is only a matter of time before someone will find them.
Once the manufacturers become aware of these vulnerabilities, they will frequently produce an update that fixes them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_update_promptly">Update Promptly</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After an update becomes available, attackers will learn about the vulnerabilities and develop 'exploits' (tools to attack) that target them.
As time passes, it will become easier and less cumbersome to attack systems and services that have not been kept up to date.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_reasons_for_not_updating">Reasons for not Updating</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the reasons people don&#8217;t update their devices/systems are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They don&#8217;t know an update is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fear that an update may 'break' a device/system&#8217;s functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A provider no longer supports the device/system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss what to do in each of these situations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_don_t_know_an_update_is_available">Don&#8217;t Know an Update is Available</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most software today will have the capacity to manually (or automatically) check for updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recommend that - as a minimum - you check for updates once a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As much as possible, enable auto-updates on as many of your devices and systems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fear_that_an_update_will_break_functionality">Fear That an Update Will Break Functionality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most devices/services have a way for you to backup the currently running version of their software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learn how to leverage the functionality to restore the system if something (like an update) renders it unusable. You can update with confidence because you know you can always fall back to something that works.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_updates_no_longer_available_unsupported">Updates No Longer Available/Unsupported</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Vendors don&#8217;t support their products indefinitely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you purchase/acquire a product, you should make a special note of its end-of-life date and plan to replace it before that date.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can&#8217;t replace something before it&#8217;s end-of-life, then you should take measures to reduce the risks associated with continuing to use it.
For example: Take it off the network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_critical_updates">Critical Updates</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, vendors will announce a critical update.
These are usually to resolve a vulnerability that is currently being attacked or is particularly easy/impactful.</p>
