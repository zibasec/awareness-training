== Content Examples

=== One line per sentance
It makes editiing, source code management and distingusing changes easier if each sentance is on it's own line

For example, don't do this:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Metus dictum at tempor commodo ullamcorper a lacus. Ac turpis egestas integer eget aliquet nibh praesent. Porta nibh venenatis cras sed felis eget velit. Amet nisl purus in mollis nunc sed.
----

Instead do this:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Metus dictum at tempor commodo ullamcorper a lacus.
Ac turpis egestas integer eget aliquet nibh praesent.
Porta nibh venenatis cras sed felis eget velit.
Amet nisl purus in mollis nunc sed.
----

=== Use line breaks for paragraphs
When writing multiple paragraphs use a single empty line for the paragraph break

For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Metus dictum at tempor commodo ullamcorper a lacus.
Ac turpis egestas integer eget aliquet nibh praesent.
Porta nibh venenatis cras sed felis eget velit.
Amet nisl purus in mollis nunc sed.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Metus dictum at tempor commodo ullamcorper a lacus.
Ac turpis egestas integer eget aliquet nibh praesent.
Porta nibh venenatis cras sed felis eget velit.
Amet nisl purus in mollis nunc sed.
----

Multiple empty lines take up space and make the source file harder to read.

=== Use AsciiDoc Admonition Blocks
Long pages of uninterrupted text are hard to read.
Ocassionaly call out important information from the text by using link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#admonition[AsciiDoc Admonition Blocks]

You should use the block format for admonition blocks, not the paragraph format.

For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[CAUTION]
.Legitimate Address; Phishing Email
====
Note that the sender address in this phishing email also uses a `comcast.net` domain.
The sender address can be spoofed.

You should still verify the addresses of links before you click them.
Look at the URL on the bottom of the image to verify.
====
----

Will render as:

[CAUTION]
.Legitimate Address; Phishing Email
====
Note that the sender address in this phishing email also uses a `comcast.net` domain.
The sender address can be spoofed.

You should still verify the addresses of links before you click them.
Look at the URL on the bottom of the image to verify.
====

The following are the default admonitions

* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* CAUTION
* WARNING

=== Images go into a folder in each module named `images/`
The makefile which generates the output expects images to exist under a folder named `images/` inside the module itself.

For example, put an image into `content/modules/Phishing-Examples/images/` and use the following to reference it from the asciidoc file:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::images/xfinity-highlight-sender-phish.png[]
----

=== Create a `[.lead]` paragraph
In your module on the first asciidoc file you should create a `[.lead]` paragraph.
This paragraph should have the synopsis of the module.

[source,asciidoc]
----
<YAML FRONT MATTER>
= A Title of your Module

== Needed Files in a module

=== `index.yml` file
Each module needs at it's root an `index.yml` file.
This file contains the metadata about the module and references each asciidoc page that makes up the module.

[source,yaml]
----
---
module_name: Phishing Examples
module_description: "Phishing Examples: Email Examples and Ways to Detect Phishing"
module_version: "v1.0.0-rc1"

full_pages:
  - phishing-examples.adoc
----

=== One or more asciidoc files
In the `index.yml` file there is a list of the included asciidoc files using the array `full_pages`.

Each of these files will have a YAML front-matter which includes metadata about the specific submodule.

[source,yaml]
----
---
submodules:
 - submodule_name: Phishing Examples
   submodule_description: "Phishing Examples: Email Examples and Ways to Detect Phishing"
   submodule_version: "v1.0.0-rc1"
   questions:
   - prompt: "Verifying a sender's email address is sufficient."
     type: QUESTION_TYPE_TF
     choices: null
     answer: false
   - prompt: "The big red alert banner on my email client is okay to ignore."
     type: QUESTION_TYPE_TF
     choices: null
     answer: false
   - prompt: "When is it okay to open attachments in email?"
     type: QUESTION_TYPE_CHOICE
     choices:
     - "Always."
     - "Only when from a known contact."
     - "Never"
     - "Only when expected and from a known contact."
     answer: "Only when expected and from a known contact."

<the rest of your content>
----

The required fields of this front matter are:

* `submodules` -- this includes an array item that contains the following required fields:
 * `submodule_name` -- self explanitory, the name of the submodule.
 * `subodule_description` -- Text description of the submodule
 * `submodule_version` -- link:https://semver.org/[Semver.org-style] Version number
 * `questions` -- Array of questions to be folded into the SCORM content.
   look at the questions documentation about the format.
   If you don't want to include questions place an empty array: `questions: []`

The top and bottom YAML delimiters (`---`)are required.
